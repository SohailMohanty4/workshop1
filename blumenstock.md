Blumenstock reminds us the positive and negative capabilities of data science in his article Don't Forget People in the Use of Big Data for Development. With the plethora of data we currently have accesibility too, it is vital we consider the potential for positive impact. Although numerous projects have used data science to advance human development, Blumenstock asserts that currently the way we analyze data has several flaws including the misuse of data, bias, and lack of regulation. Big data and machine learning have limitless possibiilties and Blumenstock's main point is data scientists, development experts, the private sector, and the government should collaborate in order to use big data in a productive and ethical manner. With the proper and well intentioned use of big data, the world can take a step in the right direction and help those in need.

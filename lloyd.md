# Response to Lloyd

Lloyd et al. introduces a number of geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution descriptions of human populations. The input datasets used in the study come from a number of major data sources including GADM, Viewfinder, Landsat, and Globocover. These datasets include values such as elevation, boundaries, annual precipitation, night lights, land cover, and water bodies. Most of the data is in rasters where each space is represented by a rectangular pixel cell. This method is a general improvement over the conventional method of obtaining data mainly due to how many different layers are incorporated and ease of access. Conventional censusâ€™s would take years to produce a map of this detail. Maps with this type of resolution makes it easier for researchers to make general observations and initiate aid efforts. 

The study does an excellent job of scaling the data and obtaining a high resolution for the data in order to increase its usability. Each dataset has a different scale so the map must adjust for that. Furthermore, the study also utilizes disaggregation to show the population of certain areas on the map. Administrative area typically refers to the regions to which the country is divided into.

# Response to Nieves et al.

Nieves et al. utilized a random forest machine learning model in order to create a predictive population weighting layer for low and middle- income countries. Random forest is a machine learning model that utilizes trees to repeatedly select the best predictors for populations. Dasymetric population allocation was utilized as the last step of the random forest process. It is the redistribution of population counts using a population density weighting layer. The study used night- time lights, energy productivity of plants, topographic elevation, climatic factors, land cover, road networks, water, and points of interest as predictors. However, results showed that urban areas and climatic covariates were the most predictive. This research is useful to help gain a consensus of the population in low and middle- income countries who do not have timely and accurate access to census data. Furthermore, it sheds light to further research as it shows the ability of covariates to predict population density.

1. Random forest is calculated using the best random selection of predictors at each node in each tree. Random forest goes through every node of every tree and uses the most predictive factors to gain an estimate for the population. Random forest is very useful because it takes many factors into consideration. some factors can have very high or very low significance and random forest accounts for this. Typically, it has similar accuracy to boosted regression trees.  
2. Machine learning provides the ability to learn from itself, which is what happens during random forest. Through every node the algorithm learns more about the predictability of the population. This random forest method defers from regular methods because, as instead of humans speculating and making population assumptions the algorithm goes through every scenario and makes such predictions. The random forest is advantageous to humans working to analyze and describe the occurence because it saves time and increases accuracy. 
3. The primary geospatial covariates used in the model are land cover which is enhanced by digital elevation, slope estimates, night time lights, and weather estimates. These data sets are typically quite large as they are representative of the whole country. 
4. Having an accurate representation of where each house and person is located is beneficial to governments as they can easily provide aid and disaster relief efforts when needed. If large disasters were to strike it would be difficult to account for people. So, having such a methodology could help save lives. Furthermore, this data set is useful for elections as governments can see what percentage of people are actually voting. 
5. Guatemala is prevalent to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, by having such an investigation of population, the government can better interpret where they can send aid.
